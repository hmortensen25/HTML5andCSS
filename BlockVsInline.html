    <div>
        This is the first piece of content.  It is in a div.
        This is also in the same div as just a bunch of text.










        This is more stuff with a bunch of returns in the middle.  Where will I be?!
    </div>

    <!-- This is another div!  A new BLOCK element -->
    <div>
        Where am I?
    </div>
    <!-- This is an IN-LINE element.  Now what?! -->
    <span>I span and I span and I span! Where will I be?</span>
    <span>I span some more</span>
    <!-- These two inline sections did not stack with the prior div because they do not belong to the prior section.  Weird huh? -->
    <div>
        Where do you think I will be?
    </div>
